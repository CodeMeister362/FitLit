### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
This application utilizes object-oriented programming to display relevant data of a given user's health profile. Data for the application is sourced externally and the application leverages multiple API calls to retrieve and process the data. It is written with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The basic architecture of this application are class files that orient a given data set. Each class has unique methods that format each data set to be more readable to the user. Test-driven development was followed to ensure each method was resiliant.
