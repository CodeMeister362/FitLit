# FitLit

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
FitLit tracks and displays a specific user's daily sleep information, physical activity, and water intake. The User is able to view different aspects of their data in relation to other users on the application. FitLit also displays trends of the user to view their physical activity data from a later scale (give me an idea of how to say this- we are displaying how often the user meets their step goal and miles walked over time

FitLit is an application that allows users to track and display their daily sleep information, physical activity, and water intake.

Users can view different aspects of their data in comparison to other users on the application, which can provide motivation and accountability. Additionally, FitLit displays trends of the user's physical activity over time, including how often the user meets their step goal and miles walked of all time. Users are also able to add new data for any day.

### Installation Instructions:

2. Navigate to the root directory by running cd FitLit in your terminal.
3. Run 'npm install' to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Start the FitLit API server by following the instructions in the [FitLit API repository](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/fitlit-api).
5. In a separate terminal window, run 'npm start' to start the local server and run the application.
6. The terminal will display 'Project is running at [URL]'. Use the link displayed in the terminal to view the application in your browser.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

-This project utilizes object-oriented programming to display relevant data of a given user's health profile
-Sources external data and leverages multiple API calls to retrieve and process the data
-Implements a local API 
-Uses POST methods to update give the ability for a user to update their data
-Includes semantic HTML to improve accessibility
-Implemented instructor feedback to improve the quality and functionality of the application
-Application is built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
-Follows test-driven development to ensure each method was resilient
-Includes class files that orient a given data set and have unique methods to format each data set to be more readable to the user
