# FitLit

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

FitLit is an application that allows users to track and display their daily sleep, physical activity, and water intake.
FitLit displays trends of the user's physical activity over time, including how often the user meets their step goal and miles walked. Users are also able to add new data for any day.


### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This application was completed as a group project for the Front-End software development program at Turing. We were approximately 13 weeks into the program. We worked on it over a two week span while learning the skills necessary to complete it.

### Learning Goals & Project Outcomes:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

-Sources external data and leverages multiple API calls to retrieve and process the data
-Implements a local API 
-Uses POST methods to give the ability for a user to update their data
-To improve accessibility, we used semantic HTML and the font Atkinson Hyperlegible designed by the Braille Institute for high readability
-Implemented instructor feedback to improve the quality and functionality of the application
-Application is built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
-Follows test-driven development to ensure each method was resilient
-Includes class files that orient a given data set and have unique methods to format each data set to be more readable to the user
-This project utilizes object-oriented programming to display relevant data of a given user's health profile
